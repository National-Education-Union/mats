This short report on multi-academy trusts (MATs) draws on a number of government sources.




## Gender Pay Pay
All the information on the disparity between men's and women's earnings is taken from the government's [Gender pay gap service](https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/).


## Teacher Retention
The teacher retention figures and the proportion of teachers who left the profession were found through a successful Freedom of Information request, https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/teacher_retention_figures_by_sch#comment-119695.

We accumulated the school totals by MAT. To even out variation we calculated a two-year rolling average by MAT.
