This short report on multi-academy trusts (MATs) draws on a number of government sources of data.

## Teacher Retention
The teacher retention figures and the proportion of teachers who left the profession were found through a successful [Freedom of Information request](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/teacher_retention_figures_by_sch#comment-119695).

We accumulated the school totals by MAT. To even out variation we calculated a two-year rolling average by MAT. The figures in on the dashboard are the average of the proportion of teachers retained in the new school year 2022-23 and 2023-24.


## Top Slice
The top slice taken by the MAT was calculated from the Department for Education's [Schools' Financial Benchmarking](https://schools-financial-benchmarking.service.gov.uk/Help/DataSources) website.
The top slice data is for the academic year 2022-23 and can be download [here](https://sat1prsfb.blob.core.windows.net/sfb/SFB_Academies_2022-23_download.xlsx).

To calculate the MAT top slice, we divided the total expenditure for the MAT (sheet CentralServices, column CC) by the sum of total income for the trust (sheet CentralServices, column BR) and all schools in the MAT (sheet Academies, column CN). 


## Gender Pay Pay
All the information on the disparity between men and women's earnings is taken from the government's [Gender pay gap service](https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/).


## Teachers' Pay
We took the pay data from [School workforce in England, Reporting year 2023](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/school-workforce-in-england). This covers the academic year 2023-24.

We compared the mean pay for each school with the mean in similar schools using the following metrics: school phase, pay region, size of school, proportion receiving pupils on free school meals, proportion of teachers with qualified teachers status, the proportion in each age band and the proportion on the leadership pay spine.

We found the degree to which schools were above or below that average. We then accumulated the mean pay for the MAT with a weighted average and accumulated the similar schools mean and found the difference for the MAT.
